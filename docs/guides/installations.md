# Installations

Before we begin, make sure you have a version `>= 7.6` of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Locally

Installing locally is what we recommend for most projects. This makes it easier to upgrade projects individually when breaking changes are introduced.

###### Using npm

```bash
$ npm i claypot
```

###### Using yarn

```bash
$ yarn add claypot
```


### Globally

Claypot also provides a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) for Claypot monitors managment. Installing globally is also we recommend for using CLI.

###### Using npm

```bash
$ npm i -g claypot
```

###### Using yarn

```bash
$ yarn global add claypot
```
