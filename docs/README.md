# Claypot

Claypot is an efficient, scalable server framework for Node.js.

*CLAYPOT IS UNDER DEVELOPING, PLEASE DON'T USE IT IN PRODUCTION ENV*


## Installations

Before we begin, make sure you have a version `>= 7.6` of Node.js installed.

##### Locally

Installing locally is what we recommend for most projects. This makes it easier to upgrade projects individually when breaking changes are introduced.

```bash
$ npm i claypot
```

##### Globally

Claypot also provides a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) for Claypot monitors managment. Installing globally is also we recommend for using CLI.

```bash
$ npm i -g claypot
```
